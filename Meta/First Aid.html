		Of course, this ought to be something that should be covered practically. Thus, ideally, this isn't something you can learn/practise by just reading. Unfortunately, even the school I went to covered just the theoretical aspects!

		<li>First Aid Box</li>
		<li>Heavy Bleeding</li>
		<li>Head Injury</li>

	<p>PS: Even a healthy heart can stop suddenly - known as sudden cardiac arrest. Death can be prevented if a CPR is performed. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nearly-85-of-cardiac-arrests-happen-outside-hospital/article23386427.ece">Some 700,000 people die due to sudden cardiac arrests</a> [each year]. With a population of 1.4 billion, and a lifespan of 80 years, that translates to a 4% chance that you'd die due to a sudden cardiac arrest, if someone around you does not know CPR!</p>
