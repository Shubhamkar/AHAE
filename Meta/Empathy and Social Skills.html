		<p>This is still more of work in progress. Currently it's more about some good shows that we think are must watch for the target age group.</p>
		<h2>Digimon Adventures</h2>
		<p>Age group: 8-14 years</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://ww5.gogoanime.io/digimon-adventure-episode-1">This</a> is the season 1. Why do we think you should watch this show? Well, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/digimon-digital-monsters/user-reviews/adult">parents like it!</a> Take your daily/weekly dose of entertainment, watching something good. I'd likely bore you by listing out the details here; so <a target="_blank" href="http://human9being9.wordpress.com/the-depths-of-adventures/">head over here</a>.</p>
		<p>If you like Adventures, you may also want to try its sequels - 02, and Tri. The latter most is for ages 13+.</p>
		<h2>Naruto</h2>
		<p>Age group: 13+ years</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://ww5.gogoanime.io/naruto-episode-1">Here.</a> About the first 150 episodes are good to great. A few episodes contain some vulgar images, but that is mostly intended in a funny way.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Assuming you have completed ICT, you should be able to find out reviews for the above two. Find them!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Thus, that constitutes some 300 &times 20 min of value-added entertainment. Of course, there can be more productive things to do. But if you want to watch some cartoons/anime, don't miss out on those two - that's our recommendation.</p>
		<h2>Novels</h2>
		<p>Research has shown that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/">reading literary fiction cultivates empathy</a>. The classic series <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-everyone-should-read-harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a>, too, can help!</p>
		<h2>Social Skills</h2>
		<p>Well, we don't understand the aspects completely. But besides reading books and watching good shows, a more productive method to develop your social skills would be to spend a few days from technology, with people alone, perhaps, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/how-summer-camp-helps-develop-your-childs-mental-health-and-resilience-246970">in a camp</a>!</p>
		<p>It is true that empathy is a subset of social skills. Being social (read extrovert) imply having good social skills. (Feel free to google what introversion and extroversion mean.)</p>
