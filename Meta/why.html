	<h2>How is the content on this website different from what the schools cover already?</h2>
	<p>Here are a few questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>As a member of a Democratic Society, do you agree that each of us ought to know (i) how the system works (ii) our role in the society ?</li>
		<li>In order to avoid giving in to the marketing gimmicks, "babas" and stuff, do you agree that we must have the thinking skills required to debunk the claims made around us, and to help us take informed decisions?</li>
		<li>Do you agree that we ought to be able to use the internet effectively as early as possible, so that, even if we do not secure admission into elite universities, we can, at least, obtain the theoretical knowledge from the internet before its too late?</li>
		<li>Do you also agree that we must have a reliable source of information about our bodies?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If your answer to all the questions above is yes, then what we just showed is that the information covered so far is a subset of the "must know" information for everyone.</p>
	<p>Yes, schools already cover these things, over a span of 4-6 years. And they cover a lot more things, which would only be useful if you choose that field. Plus, they don't cover many things they should! We think that the time schools spend on covering the "extra" things should be better spent on properly exploring the various domains of knowledge and skill, to find out what really interests you - so that when you're the age of 16 or 18 you have a better idea of what you want to do.</p>
	<p>A case in hand: top JEE rankers are often blamed for blindly choosing Computer Science over other engineering disciplines. At their age - age of 18 - very few have been exposed to the branches of engineering other than Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and may be, just may be, Mechanical! How is s/he supposed to make a better choice? Consider the fact that the amount of knowledge you gain in college is way more that you'd likely gain in schools - about 2-5 times as much!</p>
	<h2>So, what is expected?</h2>
	<p>Learning what you must know should take less than 6 months, or 180 hours. The expected age for this part is 10 or 12. Next, proceed to the "<a href="../intermediate.html" target="_blank">find what you want to learn</a>" page, find out what really interests you, until the age of 14 or 16.</p>
	<p>Once you have found out what you want to learn, learn it diligently - strive to be a master of your sub/field. Contribute to the society, in the form of new knowledge, new technologies, new products, and make this world a better place to live in! Sure, you can do it in exchange for money or fame - after all, this is the construct society developed in order to reward productive members of the society.</p>
	<p>KEEP BEING PRODUCTIVE!</p>
