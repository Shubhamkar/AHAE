<p>
The amount of information and knowledge available to humans is growing at an extremely fast pace. 
However, not everyone needs all of it - we simpy do not have the time. You must carefully choose 
the tasks in which you should invest your time - whenever you use the internet, ask yourself: How can 
I make use of this information? Or, is this information so important to me that I can ignore 
all the other tasks I must do, in order to learn it?
</p>

<p>
Don't worry if all of that does not make much sense to you at this moment. What you 
should do is - make sure you understand the answer to every "Level 0" question - whether you are 
interested or not. For the "Level 1" questions, you may only go through them, if you are interested. 
Or, if you have completed all the "Level 0" questions, proceed to "Level 1" and "Level 2" questions. 
The next paragraph need not be understood wholely either, at the beginning of this journey.
</p>

<p>
"Level 0" indicates that every human (or at least an Indian) must understand this. "Level 1" label 
indicates those questions which arise out of curiosity, and seem to serve no practical purpose. 
"Level 2" are "research-based" questions, to answer which, you will need to invest a considerable amount 
of time to understand the appropriate sub-topics in detail. These questions serve to expand the "knowledge"
that humans have acquired. Often, to answer them, you will need to consider relevant questions in "Level 1" 
- in other words, "Level 1" serves as a bridge between the must-know and the edge of the human knowledge. 
"Level 2" need not even have an answer at the moment - may be some day, you will find an answer to them!
