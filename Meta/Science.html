	<p>This is still a work in progress. The goal is to enable to learner to think scientifically (and perhaps, to enlighten the learner with various types of thinking even!) as also to illustrate the various flaws of reasoning.</p>
	<!-- We are more interested in enabling the learning to carry out effective experiments (in natural or social sciences!) to test his/her own understanding of things.</p> -->

	<h2>Thinking Scientifically (age 12-14)</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-biology-foundations/hs-biology-and-the-scientific-method/v/the-scientific-method">Khan Academy</a> has done a great job on explaining the scientific method. What we would like the reader to appreciate is that science is a "continuously improving" field of study. And that there's nothing that is "absolutely correct". We have the world around us. We make observations and get the data. We try to come up with a explanation for the data. Often, we fail to explain it with 100% consistency. But then we, or our children, or our grandchildren or their children... err... you get the idea... come up with a better explanation. "Better" in the sense that we are able to explain more of the data, perhaps, with simpler explanations. In fact, there is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor#Justifications">Occam's razor</a> which claims that simpler solutions are more likely to be correct!</p>
	<p>Just so that the reader appreciates the progress science has seen, we ask the reader to take this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hjGgFgnYIA&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNppY8ZHMPDH5TKK2UpU8Ng">Crash Course on the History of Science</a>.</p>
	<p>To summarise, the reader has three things to complete:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-biology-foundations/hs-biology-and-the-scientific-method/v/the-scientific-method">The Scientific Method (on Khan Academy)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor#Justifications">Occam's Razor</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hjGgFgnYIA&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNppY8ZHMPDH5TKK2UpU8Ng">History of Science</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Often, when a scientist thinks of a new idea, s/he works on it, and "publishes" it. This is then reviewed by multiple experts in the field, and only when they are satisfied that the idea is accepted within the scientific community.</p>
	<h2>Reasoning Fallacies (age 14-18)</h2>
	<p>We, humans, tend to use our brains to reason about things. However, we, often, commit errors. The following material should shed light on these thinking errors: <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/fallacies/">Fallacies - Writing Center - UNC</a>. Jump to "So what do fallcies look like?" for the more relevant stuff.</p>
	<p>We, therefore, request the reader to not jump to conclusions, and to stop and think thoroughly. Often, these fallacies would be encountered in news, or advertisements. Be careful then.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-logical-fallacies-used-in-everyday-arguments">This question on Quora</a> should be quite entertaining and provide leads to more relevant-to-daily-life fallacies.</p>
