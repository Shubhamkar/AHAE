	<h2>Why History?</h2>
	<p>We think that history is meant to add perspective to life - it is likely that you'd question where you stand in the grand scheme of things during your adolescent years. So, here are the perspectives.</p>
	<h2>Cosmic Evolution</h2>
	<p>Firstly, <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/splash.html">this site</a>, just because you are part of the universe. If it gets too heavy, feel free to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkD1RPDYWK8">this</a> instead.</p>
	<h2>Sapiens (Yuval Noah Harari)</h2>
	<p>And <a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/">this</a> just because you are a human being! If you prefer videos, then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGhTQ4iruLc&list=PLfc2WtGuVPdmhYaQjd449k-YeY71fiaFp">this</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<p>No, we are not going into any details about kings and kingdoms, dates and years, battles and wars. Study them if you have the interest.</p>
