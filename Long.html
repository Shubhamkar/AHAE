	<h1>About this Project</h1>
	<p>
		On this site, we embark on a text-based adventure to make sense of the various things around us, led by questions, followed by answers. Though, such a journey is only possible for things which humans know perfectly - it is humans, who have constructed them - basics of nearly everything - mathematics, sciences, political systems, technologies. This former part is suitable for the ages from 10-12 to 14-16 years. For things that we do not understand perfectly, we will be introducing some pre-existing good books and resources on the subjects. This part is suitable for the ages 14-16 and above.

		<a href="Start Here.html">We start with trying to understand a statement on the internet</a>, that should also be relevant to an average Indian, living in a democracy. For the time being, Social Science is the subject under most of the discussion - we, after all, live in a society. Dont't worry! They aren't the traditional subjects of History and Geography - I haven't found a need for those subjects for all. A non-scholar of those subjects simply doesn't need those specific subjects. What most people need is the understanding of the working and structure of government; understanding of the beliefs of diverse groups of people - we want tolerant citizens after all! Social Science does venture into Mathematics and Sciences, as also Information and Communication Technology, and the various available Careers. (See the <a href="Meta/List for Organized Study.html">List of Questions.</a>) There are better resources for Mathematics and Sciences - I haven't found such resources for the Social-Science-the-way-we-are-constructing-it. Even in science, there are some changes needed in the way it is taught - we are taught science, and we don't learn the scientific method, we don't learn about biases, we don't learn about critical thinking, we don't learn about pseudoscience!

	<h1>Process for Contribution</h1>

	<p>The progress of this project can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/Shubhamkar/AHAE/projects/1">Projects</a> page of the Github repository. (If you want to know about Github, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Github-in-laymans-terms">visit here</a>.) You are required to undertake a task in the Todo List. Once you do so, the task is to be moved to "In Progress" list, with a mention of your name. Of course, if you don't use Github, send me an email at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in. You can simply send the information required for the various pages in the common formats - txt, pdf, docx, rtf, odt. Do provide the source for the information. You will get the attribution, unless you opt otherwise.</p>

	<p>If you do use Github, clone the Handset branch to your machine; set it up; pass commits as you answer all the Level 0 questions on the page-you-undertook completely. And push. If the work is incomplete, you can keep it in the WIP (Work-in-Progress) directory. After answering all the questions, update the 'List for Organized Study' in the Meta directory. Try making it bug free; and push! Of course, there are no hard and fast rules - if you think a question's level needs to be changed, let me know; create an 'Issue'. Once this is done, the task is shifted from "In Progress" list to "Done" List. (You may want to use the Template.html in the root of the repository.)</p>

	<p>Remember: if you don't use git and github, just send the information in any written format you find comfortable - txt, html, docx, pdf, rtf, odt. I'll do the rest of the conversion.</p>
