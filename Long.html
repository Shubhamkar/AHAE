	<h1>About this Project</h1>
	<p>
		On this site, we embark on a text-based adventure to make sense of the various things around us, led by questions, followed by answers. Though, such a journey is only possible for things which humans know perfectly - it is humans, who have constructed them - basics of nearly everything - mathematics, sciences, political systems, technologies. This former part is suitable for the ages from 10-12 to 14-16 years. For things that we do not understand perfectly, we will be introducing some pre-existing good books and resources on the subjects. This part is suitable for the ages 14-16 and above.

		<a href="Start Here.html">We start with trying to understand a statement on the internet</a>, that should also be relevant to an average Indian, living in a democracy. For the time being, Social Science is the subject under most of the discussion - we, after all, live in a society. Dont't worry! They aren't the traditional subjects of History and Geography - I haven't found a need for those subjects for all. A non-scholar of those subjects simply doesn't need those specific subjects. What most people need is the understanding of the working and structure of government; understanding of the beliefs of diverse groups of people - we want tolerant citizens after all! Social Science does venture into Mathematics and Sciences, as also Information and Communication Technology, and the various available Careers. (See the <a href="Meta/List for Organized Study.html">List of Questions.</a>) There are better resources for Mathematics and Sciences - I haven't found such resources for the Social-Science-the-way-we-are-constructing-it. Even in science, there are some changes needed in the way it is taught - we are taught science, and we don't learn the scientific method, we don't learn about biases, we don't learn about critical thinking, we don't learn about pseudoscience!
	</p>
	<p>A motivation for this project can be found <a href="https://alterschoolindia.com/AHAE - Introduction.pdf">here</a> (a pdf file).</p> 

	<p>As far as Career Guidance is concerned - deciding what to spend 15-30 years of your life in is not a matter of a day or two, given the huge list of possible occupations and specializations. So, what the intention is: after the learner completes all Level 0 questions in a matter of 6 or so months; we spend the next 1 or 2 years trying out a dozen or two "broad" careers, before the age of 16 or 18. Then, once into the college, we test out a dozen specialisations in a matter of 2 years. Then, the specialisation. Of course, accomodation needs to be made for Generalists. Careere, will, therefore, be dealt separately, here.</p>

	<h1>Getting Started with Contribution</h1>

	<p id="contribute">If you use github, head straight <a href="https://github.com/digikar99/alterschoolindia/blob/master/README.md">here</a>. If you don't, you can either learn it from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Github-in-laymans-terms">here</a>; or read the next paragraphs.</p>

	<p>You are required to undertake a task in the Todo List of the <a href="https://github.com/digikar99/alterschoolindia/projects/1">Projects</a> page of the Github repository. Once you do so, the task is to be moved to "In Progress" list, with a mention of your name. Of course, if you don't use Github, send me an email at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in. As a part of this task, you are required to answer the Level 0 questions on that page, possibly in separate documents. (<a href="Meta/Levels.html">What are Levels?</a>) You can send the answers in the common formats - txt, pdf, docx, rtf, odt, html. Do provide the source for the information. You will get the attribution, unless you opt otherwise.</p> 

	<p>As far as possible, try to directly quote the relevant information from Wikipedia. If you think that that information is too difficult to understand, simplify it. Do not simplify too much - that would lead to a loss of terminology that can play a motivating factor for the reader to pursue that field, by sheer curiosity. If there's information loss resulting from simplification, inform the reader that things are simplified here, and are not exactly how they are. (For example check <a href="Social Science/02 Election.html">this page</a>.)</p>

	<p>Feel free to correct me and suggest changes to this website and its contents, by dropping an email at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in . </p>

<!--
	<p>If you do use Github, clone the Handset branch to your machine; set it up; pass commits as you answer all the Level 0 questions on the page-you-undertook completely. And push. If the work is incomplete, you can keep it in the WIP (Work-in-Progress) directory. After answering all the questions, update the 'List for Organized Study' in the Meta directory. Try making it bug free; and push! Of course, there are no hard and fast rules - if you think a question's level needs to be changed, let me know; create an 'Issue'. Once this is done, the task is shifted from "In Progress" list to "Done" List. (You may want to use the Template.html in the root of the repository.)</p>

	<p>Remember: if you don't use git and github, just send the information in any written format you find comfortable - txt, html, docx, pdf, rtf, odt. I'll do the rest of the conversion.</p>
