		On this site, we embark on a text-based adventure to make sense of the various things around us, led by questions, followed by answers. Though, such a journey is only possible for things which humans know perfectly - it is humans, who have constructed them - basics of nearly everything - mathematics, sciences, political systems, technologies. This former part is suitable for the ages from 10-12 to 14-16. For things that we do not understand perfectly, we will be introducing some pre-existing good books and resources on the subjects. This part is suitable for the ages 14-16 and above.

		<a href="Start Here.html">We start with trying to understand a statement on the internet</a>, that should also be relevant to an average Indian, living in a democracy. For the time being, Social Science is the subject under most of the discussion - we, after all, live in a society. Dont't worry! They aren't the traditional subjects of History and Geography - I haven't found a need for those subjects for all. A non-scholar of those subjects simply doesn't need those specific subjects. What most people need is the understanding of the working and structure of government; understanding of the beliefs of diverse groups of people - we want tolerant citizens after all! Social Science does venture into Mathematics and Sciences, as also Information and Communication Technology, and the various available Careers. (See the <a href="Meta/List for Organized Study.html">List of Questions.</a>) There are better resources for Mathematics and Sciences - I haven't found such resources for the Social-Science-as-we-are-constructing-it. Even in science, there are some changes needed in the way it is taught - we are taught science, and we don't learn the scientific method, we don't learn about biases, we don't learn about critical thinking, we don't learn about pseudoscience!

		So far, this site is only about 1/10th of the intended size. We invite you to contribute <a href="https://github.com/Shubhamkar/AHAE/blob/master/README.md">here</a>. If github scares you, don't worry; you can simply send me the relevant files (at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in). There is more relevant information on that page; so, you should definitely check it out.
