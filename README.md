To contribute to this project, check the [Projects](https://github.com/Shubhamkar/AHAE/projects/1 ) page. Check the items in the To-Do List; pick an item, inform me (at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in), if you use github, and have the permission, move that item to In Progress List (or inform me). If you are not familiar with github, don't worry! Inform me and pick an item, and send the file to me in .html, .docx, .pdf, .odt, .txt (or most other formats). 

What are you supposed to do: create separate files answering the Level 0 questions of the required page. Either send those files to me (at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in) (and inform me if you do not want attributions; by default, you will be given attribution); or issue a pull request. If you are creating html files, you may want to use the [Template.html](./Template.html)

You can also address the [issues](https://github.com/Shubhamkar/AHAE/issues).

A more detailed guide for contributing is available at [Contribute.md](Contribute.md).

*Note*: If I find about a dozen or two contributors, this project will be free-of-cost; and can be completed in 10-20 months' time; with each contributor contributing about 1.5hr/week. Want to contribute? Let me know at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in
