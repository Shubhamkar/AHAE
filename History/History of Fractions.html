<p align="center"><font size="+1"><b>What are fractions? (1 of 2)</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">For much of history, humans have only used the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... These numbers were used to measure different things such as 'how long is a table?', 'how many litres of milk?', 'what is the amount of grains?' and such. We measure these things by using a 'standard unit of measurement'. For example, firstly we assume that something has a given size.</p>

<p align="justify">Let us say that we have a scale. Let the length of a scale be '1 foot'. Then, we can check how many times the length of the scale is the length of the table, or a room? It can be twice as long as the scale, in which case, we call the length as 2 feet. A room can be 12 times as long as the scale. In that case, the length of the room can be called as 12 feet. But then, how were smaller lengths measured?</p>

<p align="justify">One thing that was done was that smaller units of length were defined. For example, let us fix the length of a sharpner as “1 inch”. Then, it became possible to measure the length of smaller things such as the side of a handkerchief, the length of a mobile, the length of a pencil and so on. If the handkerchief was 8 times as long as the sharpner, its length would be called 8 inches.</p>

<p align="justify">What if the length of some object is not a multiple of 1 foot? We can measure as much as we can using the scale. Let us say 3 feet. And then, if some distance remains to be measured, but is less than the length of a scale, we can check how many times the length of the sharpner is the remaing length. Suppose it is 7 inches. Then, we can write the length of that object as 3 feet and 7 inches.</p>

<p align="justify">To measure even smaller lengths, smaller units of length can be defined, such as the thickness of a refill. For much of human history, that is how measurement was done.</p>

<p align="justify">However, some people did something else. They divided the length of the scale into two equal parts. And called the length of each part as half of a foot, denoted by 1/2 ft, or <img src="./Fractions latex images/frac 1 2.svg" align="middle"/> ft. (This can be done by taking a thread of length of the scale. Folding it so that its two ends meet. Cutting at the fold. The end of the thread can be placed along the end of the scale. And then marking the point where the other end of the thread lies along the thread as 1/2 ft.) Continuing in this manner, smaller units of lengths were defined, such as half of half foot, half of half of half foot, and so on.</p>

<p align="justify">The length of the scale could also be divided into 3 equal parts. The length of each part was called one-third of a foot, and written as 1/3 ft, or <img src="./Fractions latex images/frac 1 3.svg" align="middle"> ft. Using this way, we can find lengths like one-third of one-half of a foot, or one-third of one-half of one-half of a foot. These 1/2 (or <img src="./Fractions latex images/frac 1 2.svg" align="middle"> or 1:2 or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>), 1/3 (or <img src="./Fractions latex images/frac 1 3.svg" align="middle"> or 1:3 or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>) came to be called as 'unit fractions. Thus, was born the concept of 'unit fractions'.</p>

<p align="justify">Proceeding in a similar manner, we can define <img src="./Fractions latex images/frac 1 5.svg" align="middle"> as 1 part out of 5 equal parts of an object. And so on. Using this, we can find the length of the sharpner using the length of a scale! Lengths such as one-sixth of a foot added to one-half of a foot were also used.</p>

.<br/>

<p align="justify">It was only after some more time elasped, that people began to use lengths such as twice of one-third of a foot, which came to be called as 2/3 ft. Once it was realised that we can take multiple of fractions, then lengths such as four times the one-fifth of a foot (or 4/5 ft) began to be used. Thus, was born the concept of 'fractions' in general.</p>

<p align="justify">In the fraction <img src="./Fractions latex images/frac 1 5.svg" align="middle">, '1' is called the numerator and '5' is called the denominator.</p>
