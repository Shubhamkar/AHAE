  <p align="justify">
    Elections were used as early in history as ancient Greece and ancient Rome, 
  and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope.

  In Vedic period of India, the raja (chiefs) of a gana (a tribal organization) 
  was apparently elected by the gana. The raja belonged to the noble Kshatriya varna 
  (warrior class), and was typically a son of the previous raja. However, the gana members 
  had the final say in his elections. The Pala king Gopala (ruled 750s-770s CE) in 
  early medieval Bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains. Such elections were quite 
  common in contemporary societies of the region. In Chola Empire, around 920 CE, in 
  Uthiramerur (in present-day Tamil Nadu), palm leaves were used for selecting the village 
  committee members. The leaves, with candidate names written on them, were put inside a mud pot. 
  To select the committee members, a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number 
  of positions available. This was known as the Kudavolai system.

  Ancient Arabs also used election to choose their caliph, Uthman and Ali, in the early medieval 
  Rashidun Caliphate.

  The modern "election", which consists of public elections of government officials, didn't 
  emerge until the beginning of the 17th century when the idea of representative government 
  took hold in North America and Europe.

  Questions of suffrage, especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections. 
  Males, the dominate cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the electorate and continue 
  to do so in many countries. Early elections in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States 
  were dominated by landed or ruling class males. However, by 1920 all Western European and North American 
  democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider women's 
  suffrage. Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes 
  erected to prevent fair access to elections (See Civil Rights Movement).</p>
