		We have often heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-wrong-with-the-Indian-education-system">what is wrong with the Indian education system</a>. More precisely, we don't understand why the curriculum, especially in schools, is mostly such that it is mostly useless, unless we go into academia. Why is it that even after spending 12 years in schools, we are still near-completely clueless on what to do? (Oh, we may be sure on what to "become"; but what do you wish to do with your life?)

		Enough of complaints! There are enough complainers. This site is an attempt to provide an alternative/supplementative "basic" education to an Indian, especially of around the ages of 10 to 15. Even if you are older than that, this should be useful to you, as schools have missed out on a lot of useful things. The goal of this site is to understand things that an adult must know while living in a democracy, understand the scientific method, use of the internet and basics of mathematics for day to day life; as also the various career paths available, once we reach the age of about 16.
