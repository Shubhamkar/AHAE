		We have often heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-wrong-with-the-Indian-education-system">what is wrong with the Indian education system</a>. More precisely, we don't understand why the curriculum, especially in schools, is mostly such that it is mostly useless, unless we go into academia. Why is it that even after spending 12 years in schools, we are still near-completely clueless on what to do? (Oh, we may be sure on what to "become"; but what do you wish to do with your life?)

	</p>

	<p>
		Enough of complaints! There are enough complainers. This site is an attempt to provide an alternative/supplementative "basic" education to an Indian, especially of around the ages of 10 to 15. Even if you are older than that, this should be useful to you, as schools have missed out on a lot of useful things. The goal of this site is to understand things that an adult must know while living in a democracy, understand the scientific method, use of the internet and basics of mathematics for day to day life; as also the various career paths available, once we reach the age of about 16.
	</p>
	<p>
		We embark on a journey to make a sense of the various things around us, led by questions, followed by answers. Such a journey is only possible for things which humans know perfectly - it is humans, who have constructed them - basics of nearly everything - mathematics, sciences, political systems, technologies. <a href="Start Here.html">We start with trying to understand a statement on the internet</a>, that should also be relevant to an average Indian, living in a democracy. For the time being, Social Science is the subject under most of the discussion. It does venture into mathematics and sciences, as also Information and Communication Technology, and available careers. (See the <a href="Meta/List for Organized Study.html">List of Questions.</a>)

		So, far this site is only about 1/10th of the intended size. We invite you to contribute <a href="https://github.com/Shubhamkar/AHAE/blob/master/README.md">here</a>. If github scares you, don't worry; you can find enough resources over the internet to get started. It's often good to learn different things! If you are unable to find the required help getting started with github, let me know at shubhamayare@yahoo.co.in, if I can help you.
