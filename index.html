		We have often heard <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-wrong-with-the-Indian-education-system">what is wrong with the Indian education system</a>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Enough of complaints! This site is an attempt to provide an alternative/supplementative "basic" education to an Indian, especially of around the ages of 10 to 15. Even if you are older than that, this should be useful to you, as schools have missed out on a lot of useful things. The goal of this site is to understand things that an adult must know while living in a democracy, understand the scientific method, use of the internet and basics of mathematics for day to day life; as also the various career paths available, once we reach the age of about 16. Even if you are not from India, you should check the links below, as also all the parts of the website other than some parts of Social Science.
