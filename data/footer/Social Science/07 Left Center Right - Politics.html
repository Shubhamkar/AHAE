<p><h2>Meta:</h2> This topic is a bit doubtful, as to whether 
it should be included in 
 'Level 0' topics as a must-know. How many people would really bother 
 to know about this? Do people really need to know about this? Can the 
 target-audience even 'relate' to these things, let alone 'understand'?
Can it be simplified? If so, please attempt the simplification.</p>
