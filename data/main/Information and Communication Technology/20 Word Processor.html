<blockquote><p>
A word processor is a computer program or device that provides for input, editing, formatting and output of text, often plus other features.
</p><p>
Early word processors were stand-alone devices dedicated to the function, but current word processors are word processor programs running on general purpose computers.
</p><p>
The functions of a word processor program fall somewhere between those of a simple text editor and a fully functioned desktop publishing program. However the distinctions between these three have changed over time, and are somewhat unclear.
