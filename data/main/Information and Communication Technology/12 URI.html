<blockquote><p>
In information technology, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a resource.
</p><p>
The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.
