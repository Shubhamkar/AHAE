<p>
	A bit is the most commonly unit of data. It represents one of two states - 0 or 1,  on or off, yes or no, etc. Commonly used multiples of bits are formed by using SI prefixes, and include:
	<ul>
		<li>1 nibble = 4 bits</li>
		<li>1 byte = 8 bits</li>
		<li>1 KiB (also KB) [kibibyte] = 2<sup>10</sup> bytes = 1024 bytes</li>
		<li>1 MiB [mibibyte] = 2<sup>10</sup> KiB</li>
		<li>1 GiB [gibibyte] = 2<sup>10</sup> MiB</li>
		<li>1 TiB [tibibyte] = 2<sup>10</sup> GiB</li>
		<li>1 kB [kilobyte] = 1000 bytes</li>
		<li>1 MB [megabyte] = 1000 KB</li>
		<li>1 GB [gigabyte] = 1000 MB</li>
		<li>1 TB [terabyte] = 1000 GB</li>
	</ul>
	The International Electrotechnical Commission had issued a standard to distinguish prefixes denoting powers of 10 from those of 2. These units may be used interchangeably at some places (KB in place of kB/KiB, etc); be aware of it.
