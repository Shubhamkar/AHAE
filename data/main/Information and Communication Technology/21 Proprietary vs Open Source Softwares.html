Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who have studied it, open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration.</p></blockquote>

	In simple terms, software is written in one language. This constitutes the source code. This code is compiled to machine code, which is then distributed. If source code is "4+5", then compiled form is analogous to "9". Knowing "9", you cannot tell whether it was "6+3" or "4+5" or anything else. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-binary-be-reversed-to-source-code-exactly-as-it-was-before-compilation" target="_blank">Here</a>, is a more technical explanation.
