<p>In some countries (including India), there are particular committees devoted to addressal of petitions. In India, there is the Committee on Petitions, which does this task. The details can be found <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/petition/petition.asp">here</a>.</p>

<p>Besides, there can be several informal petitions, in the form of online petitions or street rallies. As of March 2018, these do not have provide any legal obligations for the Parliament to initiate the change. These can only be useful in spreading awareness, and showing participation.
