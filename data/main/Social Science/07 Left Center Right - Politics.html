<p>'Left', 'Centre' and 'Right' labelling is a way 
of classifying different groups of people. &quot;Broadly&quot; speaking, 
'Left' denotes a 'progressive' approach, 'Right' refers to a 
'conservative approach' and 'Centre' refers to a 'moderate' approach.
Political Parties are often categorized using these adjectives. 
A single political party may take up different stances in different 
fields (such as Economics, Religion, and Law-and-Order), and 
even on different occasions. When media uses these words, often, 
there are no strict meanings with which these words are attached.</p>
