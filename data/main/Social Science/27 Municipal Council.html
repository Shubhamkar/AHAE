<p>In India,</p>
<blockquote><p>
In India, a municipal council, municipality, town municipality, Nagar Palika, Nagar Palika Parishad is an urban local body that administers a city of population 100,000 or more. Under the Panchayati Raj system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. Generally, smaller district cities and bigger towns have a Nagar Palika.
</p>
<p>The members of the Nagar Palika are elected representatives for a term of five years. The town is divided into wards according to population, and representatives are elected from each ward separately. The members elect a president among themselves to preside over and conduct meetings. Employees of the state government of India, including Chief Officer, Town Planning Engineer, Auditor, Sanitary Inspector, Medical Officer for Health, and Education Officer, among many others, who come from the state public services, are appointed to handle the administrative affairs of the Nagar Palika.
