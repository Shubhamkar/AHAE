<blockquote><p>
Economy is the set of production, consumption, supply, demand and like-wise functions put together of a region/country. Simply, when we say ‘economy of a country’ we mean every economic activity that is going on there. It is a very broad term.
</p><p>
Gross Domestic Product(GDP) is the sum of final goods and services produced within the country. Simply put, what we produce adds to GDP(there are many conditions, though).
</p><p>
Thus, GDP is only related to production. GDP is one of the many parameters which talks about economy.
