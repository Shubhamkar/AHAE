	Once you know the details, you can just input the data in 'Income Tax Calculators' that can be found online, such as <a href="https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/tools/income-tax-calculator.aspx">this</a>. Of course, precaution needs to be taken to ensure you are entering the correct details.
</p>

<p>
	However, the harder part is knowing the details. Businesses may hire 'Tax Managers' to handle the taxes. Even then, you do need to put some inputs.
</p>

<p>
	Learning the details for the first time may take 2-3 days. One can start with the <a href="https://cleartax.in/">Clear Tax</a> website.
</p>

<p>
	Note that 'Income Tax Return' is different from 'Income Tax'. On the same website you can find a <a href="https://cleartax.in/s/income-tax?ref=ct-app">Income Tax Guide</a>. Feel free to spend 10-20 hours on that website - it is more that what we could explain.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, this information is useful once you start earning yourself. Until then, you may not even want to invest much time on this task. Feel free to utilise your time elsewhere.
