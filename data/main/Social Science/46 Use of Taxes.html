	In the case of India, every year, in the month of April, the annual budget of the country is released. This budget is for a Financial Year. The Indian Financial Year lasts from April of the current year to March of the next year. This Budget decides how the tax money is utilised by the government. You can use the internet to find the budget for the current year. (Hint: Search for '20XX budget of COUNTRY'; for example, '2018 budget of india'.) The budget is also discussed in the newspapers when it is released. You may want to set a reminder in your smartphone for some day in the month of February to remind yourself to check the budget of the upcoming Financial Year.
