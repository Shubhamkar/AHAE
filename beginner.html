			<h1>STEP 0 OF 3: What is this adventure?</h1>
			
			<p>
				We will be starting our journey by starting to understand a statement on the internet. Some questions will arise while trying to understand that statement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some more questions will arise while trying to answer the previously risen questions. You will be required to go from question to question and answer to answer, to make a sense of what the original statement meant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Little by little, you will learn the answer to every question you should know about.
			<br>
			<p>
				If you think this adventure is not worth undertaking, then <a href="mailto:alterschoolindia@email.com">write to us</a> about why you think so, and what we can improve, so that others can undertake a better adventure!
			</p>
			<h1>STEP 1 OF 3: Answering every question?</h1>
			<p>Not everyone needs to know the answer to every question. In fact,</p>
			<h2>Level 0</h2>
				<p>Everyone should know the answer to some questions. These questions are indicated as "Level 0".</p>
				<p>The aim of this website is to answer only the Level 0 questions.</p>
			<h2>Level 1</h2>
				<p>There are some questions whose answers are known only by some people. And not everyone needs to know the answers to these questions. These have been indicated as "Level 1".</p>
				<p>We lack the expertise to answer Level 1 questions. Moreover, once you know the answer to all the Level 0 questions, you should also be able to use the internet for answering Level 1 questions.</p>
			<h2>Level 2</h2>
				<p>There are some questions whose answers are not known to anyone, inspite of the fact that billions of humans have habitted this Earth before! These are termed as "Level 2" questions.</p>
				<p>We have mentioned Level 2 questions for the sake of curiosity. Answering them might require you to become a monk (!), or learning as much as possible, to obtain a Ph. D. ! Examples of Level 2 questions include: Do we have Free Will? Or, is a cure for cancer possible?</p>
			<h1>STEP 2 OF 3: Know the Routes and the Map</h1>
			<p>Think of this learning process as an adventure - you are to travel on various roads. Each road corresponds to a question, and therefore has a "Route Number".
			<p>At the top of every question page, you will find a field called 'Route Number'. Since there are dozens of questions, it is not possible to go through them in one sitting.</p>
			<p>Therefore, whenever you want to take a break, note down the Topic and the Route Number, both at the top of the screen. When you return from the break, you can go to the map and directly open the question under the specific topic.</p>
			<p>Bookmark <a href="Meta/List for Organized Study.html">this</a> link to the map. This is essentially a list of all Level 0 questions on this website.</p>
			<h1>STEP 3 OF 3: Start your adventure!</h1>
			<p>Click <a href="Start Here.html">here</a> to start your adventure. You will be greeted by a pop up that introduces you to the various components of the window. Enjoy your journey, and take sufficient rest - don't travel too hastily!</p>
