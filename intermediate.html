			<p>
				<a href="beginner.html">Having known what you must know</a>, now, start discovering things what you want to know. Feel free to take help of the links below. Each is expected to take up time of the order of a 100 hours.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/index.html" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>: Take note that Computer Science is not the same as Computer Programming.</li>
				<li><a href="https://legacy.saylor.org/me101/Intro/" target="_blank">Introduction to Mechanical Engineering</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/">Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics (NASA)</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Want to add to the above list?</h1>
			<p>It's true that the above resources belong exclusively to the field of engineering - that's because all who have worked on this site, all, are students of engineering.</p>
			<p>If you have some links or books or resources that you think should be on this page, <a href="mailto:alterschoolindia@email.com">let us know</a>. Besides that the resource should take roughly 100 hours for completion, we would be looking forward to the following characteristics - </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gives a broad idea of what the field is, what sort of daily work that field involves, what sort of cutting edge works goes on in the field</li>
				<li>What sort of skills does the field require - the resource should actually make the learner experience the world through the eyes of the professional</li>
				<li>What sort of difficulties the field entails - selection ratio, subpar livelihood, long working hours</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We are on the lookout for resources including but not limited to entrepreneurship, history, biology, law, performing arts.</p>
