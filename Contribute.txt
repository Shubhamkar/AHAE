Once you undertake a task in "Todo" list in projects, the task is moved to "In Progress" list, with a mention of your name.

*************

You create a relevant folder under "WIP" (Work in progress), and keep adding information to it as .txt files, if you do not know html/css.

If you know html/css, you can convert the .txt file into a corresponding .html file.

*************

Otherwise, you can also use the Template.html file on the root page of the repo, to create the relevant files under a relevant folder in WIP.

Note that the Template.html file has linked formatting-files only for one level up.

*************

Once, all the questions (you were assigned) have been answered and converted to html, you may issue a pull request. To complete it, someone will transfer those files to relevant sections.

Once the files are converted to html format, and moved to relevant sections, the "List of All Questions" under Meta has to be updated to link those questions, as also include the new questions for self-study.

*************

Finally the task is shifted from "In Progress" list to "Done" List.

*************

As far as possible, we will directly quote introductory parts from the corresponding Wikipedia page, cut short, perhaps. And if that's too brief or heavy, we will explain it. If even that's impossible, we will either find a simpler source; or write the answer in our own words, to the best of our understanding.
