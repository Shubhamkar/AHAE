<blockquote><p>
By-elections, also spelled bye-elections (known as special elections in the United States, and bypolls in India), are used to fill elected offices that have become vacant between general elections.</p>

<p>In most cases these elections occur after the incumbent dies or resigns, but they also occur when the incumbent becomes ineligible to continue in office. Less commonly, these elections have been called when a constituency election is invalidated by voting irregularities.
