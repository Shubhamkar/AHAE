<blockquote><p>
The country is divided into different
areas for purposes of elections.
These areas are called electoral
constitutencies. The voters who live
in an area elect one representative.
</p><p>
For Lok Sabha elections, the country
is divided into 543 constituencies.
Each Parliamentary 
constituency has within it several
assembly constituencies. The same
principle applies for Panchayat and
Municipal elections. Each village or
town is divided into several ‘wards’
that are like constituencies. Each
ward elects one member of the
village or the urban local body.
