The 'seats' talked about are the members of Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha of India 
consists of 543 members. The members are elected by a system known as 'proportional system
by means of single tranferable vote system'. For simplicity, we explain here only the 'proportional 
system': the country is divided into 543 parts, known as 'electoral constituencies'. One person 
is elected from each electoral constituency. Thus, a total of 543 members are elected.</p> 

<p>In 2014, of the 
543 members of the Lok Sabha, 282 members belonged to the 
Bhartiya Janata Party.
