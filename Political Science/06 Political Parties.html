<blockquote>		
<p>A
political party is a group of people who come together to contest
elections and hold power in the government. They agree on some
policies and programmes for the society with a view to promote the
collective good. Since there can be different views on what is good
for all, parties try to persuade people why their policies are better
than others. They seek to implement these policies by winning popular
support through elections.</p>
<p>Thus,
parties reflect fundamental political divisions in a society. Parties
are about a part of the society and thus involve PARTISANSHIP . Thus
a party is known by which part it stands for, which policies it
supports and whose interests it upholds. A political party has three
components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the leaders,</li>
	<li>the active members, and</li>
	<li>the followers</li>
</ul></blockquote>
