			'To vote for a candidate' means to tell which candidate should be appointed 
			as the 'decision-maker' of your society, town/city, state or nation. The candidate with 
			most votes wins. This means that most number of peoplein that area think s/he should take the decisions
			for their area. 
			Here, candidates are those who contest with other candidates in 
			that same area, and win the election to become a public officer. A public officer 
			discuss with other public officers to take decisions to solve the problems 
			of that area.</p>
