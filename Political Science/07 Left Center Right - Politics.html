<p >'Left', 'Centre' and 'Right' labelling is a way 
of classifying different groups of people. "Broadly" speaking, 
'Left' denotes a 'progressive' approach, 'Right' refers to a 
'conservative approach' and 'Centre' refers to a 'moderate' approach.
Political Parties are often categorized using these adjectives. 
A single political party may take up different stances in different 
fields (such as Economics, Religion, and Law-and-Order), and 
even on different occasions. When media uses these words, often, 
there are no strict meanings with which these words are attached.</p>

<p><h2>Meta:</h2> This topic is a bit doubtful, as to whether 
it should be included in 
 'Level 0' topics as a must-know. How many people would really bother 
 to know about this? Do people really need to know about this? Can the 
 target-audience even 'relate' to these things, let alone 'understand'?
Can it be simplified? If so, please attempt the simplification.</p>
