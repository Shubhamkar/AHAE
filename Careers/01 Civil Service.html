<blockquote><p>
The civil service is a sector of government composed mainly of career bureaucrats hired on professional merit rather than appointed or elected, whose institutional tenure typically survives transitions of political leadership. A civil servant or public servant is a person so employed in the public sector employed for a government department or agency.</p>

<p>Many consider the study of service to be a part of the field of public administration.</p>

<p>An international civil servant or international staff member is a civilian employee who is employed by an intergovernmental organization. These international civil servants do not resort under any national legislation (from which they have immunity of jurisdiction) but are governed by internal staff regulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="ahe_ref">- extracted from <i>Civil Service, Wikipedia</i> as on 5th December 2017</p>

<p>A civil servant is, generally, highly qualified, and spends his life assisting the elected people to govern the country.</p>
