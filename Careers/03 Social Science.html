<blockquote><p>
Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a social science. The social sciences include, but are not limited to: anthropology, archaeology, demography, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, management, political science, culture , psychology, and sociology. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_social_science">Outline of social science</a>.

<p>Once you are done with the Level 0 questions, especially before the age of 18, you should read some good books covering some aspects of Social Science to see whether you'd like to choose it as an academic field of study; or even, just out of interest.</p>
