<p>If a religion is something that tells what is God and how to worship him, then Hinduism may not be a religion; for there are many different different groups, having different Gods and ways of worshiping him. If, on the other hand, religion includes teachings that teach one how to live life, what is righteousness and all, it becomes equivalent to a way of life. Often times, the 'way of life' of a Muslim would differ from a non-Muslim.  </p> 

<p>Let us also accept that language can be ambiguous at times. This question may not as important as the question of whether such and such behaviour leads to the violation of the basic human rights.</p>

<!--IMO, it is of paramount importance that the state does not dictate how we live our life, as long as the four basic human rights are not violated.-->
