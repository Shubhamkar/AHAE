<blockquote><p>Judicial independence is the concept that the judiciary needs to be kept away from the other branches of government. That is, courts should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government, or from private or partisan interests. Judicial Independence is vital and important to the idea of separation of powers.</p></blockquote>

<p class="ahe_ref">- extracted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judicial_independence&oldid=822999212"><i>Judicial Independence, Wikipedia</i></a> as on 10th March 2018</p>

<blockquote><p>
Independence of
judiciary means that the other organs of the government
like the executive and legislature
must not restrain the functioning
of the judiciary in such a way that:
it is unable to do justice,
 the other organs of the government
should not interfere with the
decision of the judiciary,
judges must be able to perform
their functions without fear or
favour.</p>

<p>
Independence of the judiciary does
not imply arbitrariness or absence of
accountability. Judiciary is a part of
the democratic political structure of the 
country. It is therefore accountable to the Constitution,
to the democratic traditions and to the people of the
country.
</p>

<p>In any society, disputes are bound to arise between individuals,
between groups and between individuals or groups and government.
All such disputes must be settled by an independent body in
accordance with the principle of rule of law. This idea of rule of law
implies that all individuals — rich and poor, men or women, forward
or backward castes — are subjected to the same law. The principal
role of the judiciary is to protect rule of law and ensure supremacy
of law. It safeguards rights of the individual, settles disputes in
accordance with the law and ensures that democracy does not give
way to individual or group
dictatorship. In order to be able to do
all this, it is necessary that the
judiciary is independent of any
political pressures.</p></blockquote>
