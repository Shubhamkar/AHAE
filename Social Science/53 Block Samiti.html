<blockquote><p>
Mandals, taluka panchayats, block panchayats, or panchayat samiti are rural local governments (panchayats) at the intermediate level in panchayat raj institutions (PRI).</p>
<p>
It has been said to be the &quot;panchayat of panchayats&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The 73rd Amendment defines the levels of panchayati raj institution as :
<ul>
<li>District (or apex) level</li>
<li>Intermediate level</li>
<li>Base level</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
They operate at the tehsil (taluka) level and govern the villages of the tehsil that together are called a development block. The panchayat samiti is the link between the gram panchayat (village council) and the zila parishad (district board).[3] The name varies across states: mandal praja parishad in Andhra Pradesh, taluka panchayat in Gujarat, and mandal panchayat in Karnataka.
</p>
<p>Typically, a panchayat samiti is composed of elected members of the area: the block development officer, members of the state's legislative assembly, members of parliament belonging to that area, otherwise unrepresented groups, associate members (such as a farmer, a representative of the cooperative societies and one from the agricultural marketing services sector) and the elected members of that panchayat block (tehsil) on the zila parishad (district board).</p>
