<blockquote><p>
An argument from nonbelief is a philosophical argument that asserts an inconsistency between the existence of God and a world in which people fail to recognize him. It is similar to the classic argument from evil in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through.</p>

<p>There are two key varieties of the argument. One of these is the argument from reasonable nonbelief (or the argument from divine hiddenness). This was first elaborated in J. L. Schellenberg's 1993 book Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason.</p>

    <p>The argument goes as follows:</p>
<ol><li>If no perfectly loving God exists, then God does not exist.</li>
<li>If a perfectly loving God exists, then there is a God who is always open to personal relationship with each human person.
</li>
    <li>If there is a God who is always open to personal relationship with each human person, then no human person is ever non-resistantly unaware that God exists.
</li>
    <li>If a perfectly loving God exists, then no human person is ever non-resistantly unaware that God exists (from 2 and 3).
</li>
    <li>Some human persons are non-resistantly unaware that God exists.</li>
<li>No perfectly loving God exists (from 4 and 5).</li>
<li>God does not exist (from 1 and 6).</li>
    </ol>
        
<p>Arguments against this include: what is perceived as hiddeness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides the arguments mentioned above, there are several arguments, both in support of and against the 'argument from non belief'.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, we all are humans, and that alone should be the reason to help each other.</p>
