<blockquote><p>
A gram panchayat (village council) is the grassroots-level of panchayati raj system in India at the village or small-town level, and has a sarpanch as its elected head.</p>

<p>The failed attempts to deal with local matters at the national level caused, in 1992, the reintroduction of panchayats for their previously used purpose as an organisation for local self-governance. There are about 250,000 gram panchayats in India, that are being gigabit-broadband enabled under the BharatNet and Digital India initiative.
</p>
<p>Gram panchayats are panchayats at base level in panchayat raj institutions (or PRIs)</p>
<p>The gram panchayat is divided into wards and each ward is represented by a Ward Member, also referred to as a Panch or Panchayat Member, who is directly elected by the villagers. The panchayat is chaired by the president of the village, known as a Sarpanch. The term of the elected representatives is five years. The Secretary of the panchayat is a non-elected representative, appointed by the state government, to oversee panchayat activities.</p>
