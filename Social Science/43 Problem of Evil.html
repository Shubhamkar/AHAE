<blockquote><p>
The problem of evil refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of evil with an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent God (see theism). An argument from evil attempts to show that the co-existence of evil and such a God is unlikely or impossible. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of theodicy. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of theology and ethics.</p>
<p>
The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil, while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God. The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human cruelty against them.</p>

<p>Some arguments in favour of God's existence alongside evil include: existence of free will allows us to perform evil things. Free will (alongwith evil) is better than no free will (without evil). Another argument claims that God is either not omnipotent, omniscient or omnibenevolent; and that is why, evil exists. Still another argument claims that evil makes us realise the value of good.</p>

<p>The problem of evil is also discussed in religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism. The argument here is that God is not the cause; it is karma that is the driving principle of the world.</p></blockquote>
