**History**

At one point of time, I dreamt of a school. Having known the hurdles to establish the school, the resources required to manage it good, and its limitations, I gave up on that path. Instead, I thought, why not make a document that enlightens the reader with all the necessary knowledge, that enlightens the reader how to seek knowledge and create knowledge.

In this 'A Holistic Adventure in Education', I have made an effort to promote learning with the help of curiosity. (Our Maharashtra (India) HSC class 11 and 12 had made such an effort - and it made learning grammar from that book, in an organized manner, incredibly difficult.) While I have been a subject of such a process, if an overview exists, this mode of learning "seems" to be highly interesting; without the overview, it is as confusing as life! I have organized each topic into various 'topics' and 'levels'. Level 0 implies must know. Level 1 is to test your interest; while level 2 is to deepen your knowledge. 

**Target Age Group:** This HyperTextBook has been written with a target age of 10-11 years. 

**Software required:** For the 'math' part, Firefox works; Chrome doesn't. (MathML support) For the remaining sections, most browsers would work. 

*Android*: One needs to adjust the address properly. If the folder is stored on Device Storage, 'file:///storage/emulated/0/pathname/Start Here.html', where 'pathname' is the Folder under 'Device Storage' where these pages are located. For example, if these pages are stored at 'Downloads/AHAE - BootStrap', then pathname="Download/AHAE - BootStrap". This works with Firefox at the least.

*Recommendation*: It is recommended that this be viewed in landscape mode, or preferably on a larger screen - tablet/laptop/monitor. Larger display area does aid in grasping.

**Topics Covered**

I felt Mathematics, Sciences, Social Science, ICT, Health to be the most important topics - all of them have not yet been covered. Feel free to make suggestions.

**Contribute**

Estimated time for the completion of this project is 1200 hours. I would be glad for any help - 1.5hr/week.
