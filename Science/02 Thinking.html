<p>At a restaurant, you may order your favourite items, without giving much thought. Or buy your favourite flavoured ice-cream, without much thought. You should agree that this type of thinking is different from the thinking you use to solve a math problem.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are various types of thinking - creative, analytical, holistical, critical, concrete, abstract, divergent, sequential.</p> <!-- http://thepeakperformancecenter.com/educational-learning/thinking/types-of-thinking-2/ -->

<p>These various types of thinking skills are best learnt with a skilled guide/teacher/friends/anyone-else.</p>

<p>You will become more familiar with what we are speaking about as you grow older, and as your brain becomes more mature (adult-like). So, you will want to read about this after a few years. But that doesn't mean you can't think in different ways now. It's just that you may not become aware of it when you are thinking in a particular manner. </p>

<!-- META: Is it worth spending time to understand and create material to understand each of these skills, and then revisit the whole material to identify which type of thinking is utilized is used when and where. The latter - I don't even see a clear boundary separating these types. -->

<!--
<p>Critical Thinking is a way of thinking, and so, to understand it, you will need to think in that manner. Some <a href="http://www.adlit.org/article/21409/">studies</a> indicate that one needs more knowledge about the topic, to think critically about that topic.</p>
<p>In simple words, it means questioning everything. Ask questions about whatever you read/listen. Ask why and how. Question your own beliefs. Check which things are assumptions. Check which things lead to which other things.</p>
<p>Check whether you can form a picture in your head from the words that you read.</p>
