Science - the quest to understand nature - stands out on its own. While we could have given a "discourse" on various topics and principles of science - that is not how science is! Science isn't supreme. It is "our" "attempt" to understand nature. In other fields, we understand what exactly it is that we want to say. Everyone agrees that that is how things are. There is consensus among everyone about the use of terms. No one would argue that in India, we don't have Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. No one would argue the meaning of percentage, or fractions. These are "human constructions".

Science, on the other hand, is an attempt to understand things which "we" did not make. They have been in existence even before mankind. We only attempt to understand them. May be, some day, we will understand it exactly what it is - until then, all we do is "model" them. We try to understand the things in nature by constructing analogies. We observe things, find an underlying pattern, predict, and test our predictions by further observations. All this will become clear with an example.
