What would you see, if you could "zoom in" on your skin?

It was in 1665, that someone "zoomed in" on a piece of cork. (In the image, each piece is a cork - roughly the size of your thumb - the sizes can vary.) (For our purpose, similar things could be seen if you would zoom in "enough" on a piece of wood as well.)
