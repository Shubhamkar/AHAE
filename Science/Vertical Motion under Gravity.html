<p>When a light object (paper) and heavy object (ball) are released from the same height, which will reach the ground faster? The heavy object, right? But, what if both the objects are heavy - say, a tennis ball, and a football? Try it! Does the heavier object (football) still reach the ground faster than the lighter object (tennis ball)? Why?</p>

<p>
If wind is blowing, which object flies easily - paper or ball?
</p>

<p>
Based on the observations, can we conclude that lighter objects (paper) are affected more by wind than heavier objects (ball).
</p>

<p>
For the time being, assume that the effect of wind and air is the same in the experiments above. (We will investigate this phenomenon later.) And you know that we are surrounded by air. So, in the experiment above, can we conclude that two objects dropped from the same height reach the ground in the same time, regardless of how heavy they are? And also that this wasn't the case with paper and ball, because the paper was affected by air more than ball?
</p>

<p>
That is our conclusion - ignoring the effects of wind/air, two objects (of same or different) dropped from the same height reach the ground in the same time.
</p>

<p>
Mankind has been studying nature from a few 1000 years. Yet, it was only in 1600 AD (about 400 years ago), that the conclusion above was realised. Until then, people believed that heavier objects reach the ground faster than lighter objects.
