Once you undertake a task in "Todo" list in projects, the task is to be moved to "In Progress" list, with a mention of your name.

*************

**Phase 1: Assimilating Information**

You are most suited for this phase, if you do not know about html/css. 

In this phase, you create a relevant folder under WIP (Work in Progress), and create the relevant files. Include a completed label in the folder name, once you complete collecting information in the .txt files. This folder is to kept in WIP only. Follow-up questions should be included.

Once this is done, update the task to reflect that this phase is done; you may remove your name, once done; unless you also want to do the Phase 2

*Note:* As far as possible, we will directly quote introductory parts from the corresponding Wikipedia page, cut short, perhaps. And if that's too brief or heavy, we will explain it. If even that's impossible, we will either find a simpler source; or write the answer in our own words, to the best of our understanding. 

**Phase 2: Organising Information**

You can do this phase, if you have at the least some information about html/css. In addition, if you want to contribute to math sections, you may need to [install firefox-esr](https://askubuntu.com/questions/894871/how-do-i-install-firefox-52-esr-on-16-04/897911#897911) (for Linux) and install the [Firemath plugin](https://askubuntu.com/questions/894871/how-do-i-install-firefox-52-esr-on-16-04/897911#897911) to produce math expressions using MathML. There's no learning curve to using these tools.

Once, you have pulled the Updates branch, copy the Template.html file to relevant topic-folders.
1. Using this template, and the relevant file in WIP, create the html version in the relevant folder.
2. Once the .html file is created, update the relevant links, as also the 'List of all questions' under Meta. Ensure that the route number and the question number in the list match each other.
Repeat the above steps for the remaining files of one single folder under WIP. Then commit and push, to Updates branch.
3. The 'List of all questions' should also include the self-study questions.

*Note:* The Template.html file has linked formatting-files only for one level up.

Finally, the task is shifted from "In Progress" list to "Done" List.
