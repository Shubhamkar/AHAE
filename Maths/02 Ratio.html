<blockquote>

<p>In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. For example, if a bowl of fruit contains eight oranges and six lemons, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).</p>

<p>The numbers in a ratio may be quantities of any kind, such as quantities of persons, objects, lengths, weights, etc.
</p>

<p>A ratio may be either a whole number or a fraction.</p>

<p>
A ratio may be written as "a to b" or a:b, or it may be expressed as a quotient of "a and b".
</p>

<p>
When the two quantities are measured with the same unit, as is often the case, their ratio is a dimensionless number. A quotient of two quantities that are measured with different units is called a rate.</p>
