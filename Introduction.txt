At one point of time, I dreamt of a school. Having known the hurdles to establish the school, the resources required to manage it good, and its limitations, I gave up on thaqt path. Instead, I thought, why not make a document that enlightens the reader with all the necessary knowledge, that enlightens the reader how to seek knowledge and create knowledge.

In this 'A Holistic Adventure in Education', I have made an effort to promote learning with the help of curiosity. [Our Maharashtra (India) HSC class 11 and 12 had made such an effort - and it made learning grammar from that book, in an organized manner, incredibly difficult.] While I have been a subject of such a process, if an overview exists, this mode of learning "seems" to be highly interesting; without the overview, it is as confusing as life! I have organized each topic into various 'topics' and 'levels'. Level 0 implies must know. Level 1 is to test your interest; while level 2 is to deepen your knowledge. 

This HyperTextBook has been written with a target age of 10-11 years. For this edition, firstly, a test is needed to be conducted as to whether the target audience can really digest the material here. A test was conducted on a girl of age 10 having somewhat higher-than-average understanding, on a smartphone. Understanding was okay. It turned out that the screen size of the medium does play an important role in understanding - seeing the entire page contributes to understanding than seeing just a part of a page.

The book works well with Firefox and UC Browser, but not with Chrome, Dolphin, HTML viewer, etc on pre-Nougat Android, due to issues I don't yet understand.

I felt Mathematics, Sciences, Political Science, ICT, Health to be the most important topics - all of them have not yet been covered. Feel free to make suggestions. Contributions are welcome.
